        <h2>THE GUARDIAN ANGELS TETU CATHOLIC PARISH</h2>
        <p className='text-secondary container-fluid'>The following is the history of Tetu Catholic Parish from when it was founded to the way we know today 30/04/2022.</p>
        <h3 className='titles'>Preface</h3>
        <p className='text-secondary container-fluid'> A people that lives without knowing its origins and its past is a people that disconnects from the wisdom and culture of its fathers and forefathers. Our culture as a Catholic Christian Community is that of faith. Ignorance of our history would disconnect us from our fathers and mothers who begun and grew up our parish through decades. That would disconnect us from our local deposit of faith. In this recognition Fr. Patrick Maina (Jamaica) asked the liturgical committee to search for, and write the history of this important parish that would be handed down to the faithful of the current age and to those who are to come. The reflection on the journey that Tetu Catholic Parish has done is all meant to make us see how God works salvation for His people throughout ages. It’s supposed to have as its ultimate goal, stronger faith amongst Christians at Tetu and its metropolitan Parishes. </p>

          <h3 className='titles'>Acknowledgement</h3>
          <p className='text-secondary container-fluid'>The liturgical committee acknowledges all persons of goodwill who gave their precious time to narrate what they experienced at various epochs in the history of the parish.<br/><br/>
          The committee wishes to thank in a special way Fr Ardila Genaro, the father in charge of the Consolata missionaries’ archives in Rome. Fr. Genaro did not only allow this committee to penetrate into the Consolata archives, but he also took time to get documents, scan them and avail them to our committee. A special mention also goes to Brother Wekesa, rector of the Blessed Joseph Allamano formation Centre Mathari who allowed this committee into the community library.  Br. Wekesa also introduced this committee to his superiors in Rome so that we could easily be provided with Information.<br/><br/>
          We also acknowledge the support offered by Rev. Fr. Patrick Maina. When he first asked this committee to write the history of Tetu parish, It felt like an impossible task, but on setting upon the work, each day, we learnt new things and we were burning with urge to share the same knowledge with our fellow parishioners.<br/><br/><br/>
          Finally, we acknowledge the support of the entire parish council led by Mr. Geoffrey Muchiri.</p>
          <h3 className='titles'>HISTORY</h3>
          <p className='text-secondary container-fluid'>On the 20th of June 1902, four Consolata missionaries namely; Fr Thomas Gays, Fr. Fillipo Perlo, Br. Celeste Lusso and Br. Luigi Falda arrived in Kikuyu land. They were received by Chief Karuri of Tuthu-Murang’a. People have always wanted to know how an African chief would have willingly received whites in his territory. At the time, seen the bitter relations between the locals and the colonizers, any reception of whites in a given zone would mean receiving land grabbers and white masters. The Holy Spirit works in His own ways. Chief Karuri thought of the civilization that the four white men were capable of bringing to his community. Little did he know that the men would actually evangelize his community and leave them the highest Good.<br/><br/><br/>
          From Tutho, Fr. Thomas travelled further to the North and arrived in Tetu on 2/10/1902. Initially, Chief Karuri had warned him that around Tetu region, whites were being brutalized and at times murdered by the locals. On arrival instead, Fr Thomas found a friendly reception. The locals were willing to work with him.<br/><br/>
          2nd October is the feast of Guardian Angels Sunday. Fr. Thomas Gays laid the foundation stone of what would develop to become Guardian Angels Tetu Parish. He entrusted the would be parish to the protection of the Guardian Angels. (hence our patron Angels todate).<br/><br/>
          A process to obtain paperwork and permits from the local English authorities begun immediately and they were finally issued in 1903.  Soon after, Fr. Thomas built a small church. The walls and the roof of that first small church were made of dry banana leaves. He also built a small house with a kitchen.<br/><br/>
          Due to his many activities, It was becoming increasingly difficult to fully begin the Mission. Fr. Thomas, had been appointed Superior of the other three Consolata missionaries by Fr. Joseph Allamano. So he was also coordinating Missionary work in other places. In 1905, Fr. Vignoli arrived to help. By 1907, the mission had become a parish and Fr. Bellozzi became the first parish priest. It is Fr. Bellozzi who baptized the first Christian at Tetu Parish. That first person to be baptized at Guardian Angels Tetu Parish was Sebastian Makara baptized on 19th August 1907. The 2nd and third persons to be baptized were Pietro de Luca Muthiiutuku and Maria Angela Nyutu who were baptized on 2nd July 1909 and 25th July 1909 respectively.<br/><br/>
          In 1908, Fr. Thomas came back to Tetu and built a house for sisters. This was was first occupied by the Cottolengo sisters who arrived at Tetu in 1909. The arrival of Sisters was such a blessing to the Mission. They immediately got engaged in the community, mainly taking care of sick, visiting homes, praying with the locals and teaching catechism. In 1911, Fr. Bianciotto became the parish priest and he was replaced  1918. <br/><br/>
          Soon after Fr. Benedetto Pietro became the new parish priest with Fr. Comoglio being his assistant. <br/><br/><br/>
          It was Fr. Benedetto built the second big church, whose picture is here below.<br/><br/><br/>
          {/* Picture here */}
          The church is built of bamboo and papyrus roofing. (obtaining a picture soon)<br/><br/><br/>
          Fr. Benedetto then started the department of catechism in 1920; he built some small oratorio (place of games). This way he would attract persons who would later become his catechumens. Together with catechism, he is the first person to organize a a funds drive at Tetu to complete the church. From the same collection he was able to start a school where locals would learn technical courses.<br/><br/>
          In 1931, Fr. Mariondo replaced Fr. Benedetto who left for Sabbatical before jetting back in 1932. On re entry, Fr. Benedetto established and built schools like Tetu Primary, Githakwa, Wamagana and Karangia. <br/>
          When Fr. Benedetto arrived in Tetu in 1918, the Christian population was composed of 64 persons. When he left in 1934, the catholic community had grown to 699 persons. He was then transferred to Nanyuki and his place was taken by Fr. Cangilo.<br/><br/>
          In 1940, a local Consolata priest Fr. Martino Wacira took over the parish and he served for three months. In the same year, and in the face of World War 2, the colonial government deported all Italian Nationals. The Consolata fathers who were Italian were all deported to South Africa and Tetu Parish was left in the hands of an American priest Fr. John Max, a Holy Ghost missionary. He replaced the parish priest until the end of war in 1945 when Fr. Mauro, a Consolata missionary came back and took over the parish. His assistant was Fr. Pronutto.<br/>
          Before the end of 1945 Fr. Cangilo came back to Tetu and took over the parish priesthood. His assistant was Fr Barra and Fr Sestero. He built a proper kitchen. He also built a dispensary adjacent to the Parish Church. They then enlarged the Tetu Girls Primary School. During his stay Fr Cangilo baptized 1500 persons and officiated 200 marriages.<br/><br/><br/>
          In 1950, Fr Sestero assisted by Fr. Cristoforo Colombo took over the parish. These are remembered for their efforts in establishing a liturgical choir and for having made a playground. They also  administratively structured the teaching at their schools.<br/><br/>
          In 1951, Fr. Meraviglia assisted by Fr Pronutto and Fr Consolanti took over the mission. Working with some leaders of the community, namely; Mr. Philip Nduhiu, Mr. Harrison Ngatia, Mr. Wahome Ngeituga and Mr. Antony Muthigeni, they asked the local English authorities for expansion of land. They were allocated another 5 acres.<br/><br/>
          Fr. Meraviglia is remembered by the Christians of Tetu for having been a truly loving and caring father to all during the turbulent times of the Mau Mau uprising and the violence that came up with it. He had a way of protecting the people, especially those who had converted to Christianity. <br/>
          In 1955, Fr Mongiano became the parish priest. His assistants were Fr. Motter, Fr. Briganti and  Fr Jenarius.  Fr. Mongiano is remembered for having built the local centers at Muthua-ini, Gitathi-ini, Ihithe, Karangia, Gatundiro, Kigogoini, Icagaciru, Gathuthu, Kihatha and Kagogi. At that time Bishop Cavallera (the ordinary of Nyeri diocese) carried out a missionary appeal in Italy to obtain funds to help persons who had been devastated by  war. In recognition of the hard work of Fr Mungiano, Bishop Cavallera allowed some of the funds to used to build Tetu boys and Mathakwa-ini. He also put up a home craft school at Tetu and a dispensary at Ihithe.<br/>
          It’s during Fr Mongiano time that the number of Catholic faithful doubled to 4160 persons.<br/>
          In 1960, Fr. Arbinolo took over from Fr Mongiano. He is remembered for having thatched Tetu boys primary  with iron sheets.<br/>
          In 1961, Fr Magnabosco took over. He is the one who built Tusha, Muthua-ini and Kigogo-ini. In the same year, Fr Zordan also served here.<br/>
          It is in this 1961 that a young priest with origins in Tetu, became the first African Bishop of the diocese of Nyeri. This was Bishop Ceasar Maria Gatimu. It was a big blessing to the parish and to the entire region.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

          In 1962, Bishop Cavallera desired to open IMC Missions in the North of the country. The personnel was not enough. He requested for volunteer priests from Italian dioceses. He found some in Pandova and  in 1962, he entrusted to them the Tetu Mission in order to deploy his own IMC missionaries in the north. Some of the known names who worked as volunteer priest at Tetu Parish is Fr. Luigi Paiaro (later the Bishop of Nyahururu)<br/><br/>
          In 1964, Fr Louis assisted by Fr Mauro took charge. He is remembered for having reorganized the young boys and forming a scout movement, the 11th troop in 1965, assisted by Fr Resini Rigoni, Zordan sought help from Padua Italy and he put up a church at Wamagana. He also took up Fr Mongiano’s initiative of thatching churches with iron sheetsa and putting proper floors.<br/><br/>
          In 1967, the parish was under Frs. Siro, Fr John Tebaldi, Fr. Migandi, Fr Mario Carpelli and Fr Massa. These are all remembered due to their commitment to School apostolate. They increased visits to schools and villages.<br/><br/>
          In 1/1/1971, Fr  Paul Sorgon, Fr Vaccari and Fr Massa took charge of the parish. They changed the home craft school at Tetu to Tetu girls boarding Primary School. <br/><br/>

          <h3 className='titles'>The first Parish Council.</h3>
          <p className='text-secondary container-fluid'>
          In 1/1/1971, Fr. Vaccari formed the very first parish council and 12 local councils. Initially fathers had made every decision without much input from the people. After seventy years of evangelization, Fr. Francesco Mino Vaccari established the very first Parish Curiae alongside 12 local council from all the local centres. <br/><br/>
          On the 1st June 1971, the new parish council decided to upgrade all the local centres. It established that every Christian pay Shillings twenty (KES 20.00) annually for the purposes of developing the said houses of prayer. The first beneficially of this programme was Mununga-ini local centre that hosted the parish. <br/><br/>
          In October of the same year, the foundation stone for the Kiandu church was laid by Bishop Gatimu. It is remembered that in a fundraiser organized for this purpose, Fr. Zordan alone contributed Shillings two thousand five hundred (KES 2500) (a conspicuous figure by then).<br/><br/>
          In October 1972, the parish council begun  a new program of home blessings. Eventually, Masses could also be celebrated at homes.  In the same month and year, the parish council organized for a fundraiser to build a church at Ihithe<br/><br/>
          By the end of 1972, the Catholics’ population had grown to five thousand two hundred (5200) and by the end of 1973, 280 marriages had been celebrated at the Parish<br/><br/><br/>
          The committee in charge continues to write this history.<br/><br/>
